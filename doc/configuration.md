# Configuration guide

I think, the best starting point for creating your own yaml configuration,
is to look at the [example.yaml](example.yaml) file from the project
documentation. This configuration was written with the functionality of the
original firmware in mind and it makes use of all available options. This
configuration guide can be used to fill in the blanks.

The `xiaomi_bslamp2` platform provides various components that expose the
core functionalities of the lamp. In the following table, you can find what
components are used for exposing what physical components of the lamp.

  | Part                       | Component(s)                                                     |

## Platform: xiaomi_bslamp2

At the core of the hardware support is the `xiaomi_bslamp2` platform, which
provides two hub-style hardware abstraction layer (HAL) components that are
used by the other components: one for driving the GPIO's for the RGBWW leds
and one for the I2C communication between the ESP32 and the front panel.

I do mention the platform configuration here for completeness sake, but
generally you will not have to add the following configuration option to
your yaml file. It is loaded automatically by the components that need it,
and the GPIO + I2C configurations are fully prepared to work for the Bedside
Lamp 2 wiring out of the box. Therefore, you will not find this piece of
configuration in the [example.yaml](example.yaml).

Having said that, here are the configuration options:

```yaml
xiaomi_bslamp2:
  # Options for the RGBWW LEDs HAL.
  red: "GPIO13"
  green: "GPIO14"
  blue: "GPIO5"
  white: "GPIO12"
  master_1: "GPIO33"
  master_2: "GPIO4"
  
  # Options for the Front Panel HAL.
  sda: "GPIO21"
  scl: "GPIO19"
  address: 0x2C
  trigger_pin: "GPIO16"
```

The only reason that I can think of for adding this platform configuration
to your yaml file, would be if you blew one or more or the ESP32 pins, and
need to rewire functionality. In other casis, simply omit the section.

## Component: light

The light component creates an RGBWW light. This means that it can do
colored light and cold/warm white light based on a color temperature.

```yaml
light:
  - platform: xiaomi_bslamp2
    name: My Bedside Lamp
    id: my_bedside_lamp
    default_transition_length: 0.5s
    effects:
      - random:
          name: Randomize
          transition_length: 3s
          update_interval: 3s
    on_brightness:
      - then:
          - logger.log: The brightness changed!
    presets:
      my_color_presets:
        red:         { red: 100%, green: 0%,   blue: 0%   }
        green:       { red: 0%,   green: 100%, blue: 0%   }
        blue:        { red: 0%,   green: 0%,   blue: 100% }
        yellow:      { red: 100%, green: 100%, blue: 0%   }
        purple:      { red: 100%, green: 0%,   blue: 100% }
        randomize:   { effect: Randomize                  }
      my_white_presets:
        cold:        { color_temperature: 153 mireds      }
        chilly:      { color_temperature: 275 mireds      }
        luke:        { color_temperature: 400 mireds      }
        warm:        { color_temperature: 588 mireds            
```

### Configuration variables:

* **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the light.
* **id** (*Optional*, ID): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
  By providing an id, you can reference the light from automation rules
  (e.g. to turn on the light when the power button is tapped)
* **default_transition_length** (*Optional*, Time): The transition length to
  use when no transition length is set in a light call. Defaults to 1s.
* **effects** (*Optional*, list): A list of
  [light effects](https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#light-effects)
  to use for this light.
* **presets** (*Optional*, dict): Used to define presets, that can be used
  from automations. See [below](#light-presets) for detailed information.
* **on_brightness** (*Optional*, Action): An automation to perform when the
  brightness of the light is modified.
* All other options from [the base Light
  implementation](https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#config-light),
  except for options that handle color correction options like
  `gamma_correct` and `color_correct`. These options are superceded by the
  fact that the light component has a fully customized light model, that
  closely follows the light model of the original lamp's firmware.

### Light modes

The lamp supports multiple light modes. These are:

* **RGB light** (input: RGB + brightness > 1%)
* **White light** (input: Color Temperature + brightness > 1%)
* **Night light** (input: RGB or White light + brightness at 1%)

In the original firmware + Yeelight Home Assistant integration, the night
light feature is implemented through a switch component. The switch can be
turned on to activate the night light mode. In this ESPHome firmware,
setting the brightness to its lowest value triggers the night light mode.
This makes things a lot easier to control.

It is possible to control the night light mode separately. An example of
this can be found in the [example.yaml](example.yaml), in which holding the
power button is bound to activating the night light.

### light.disco_on Action

This action sets the state of the light immediately
(i.e. without waiting for the next main loop iteration),
without saving the state to memory and without publishing
the state change.

```yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - light.disco_on:
        id: my_bedside_lamp
        brightness: 80%
        red: 70%
        green: 0%
        blue: 100%
```

The possible configuration options for this Action are the same
as those for the standard `light.turn_on` Action.

### light.disco_off Action

This action turns off the disco mode by restoring the state
of the lamp to the last known state that was saved to memory.

```yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - light.disco_off:
        id: my_bedside_lamp
```

### Light presets

The presets functionality was written with the original lamp firemware
functionality in mind: the user has two groups of presets available: one for
RGB light presets and one for white light presets (based on color
temperature). The color button (the top one on the front panel) can be
tapped to switch to the next preset within the active preset group. The same
button can be held for a little while, to switch to the other preset group.

In your light configuration, you can mimic this behavior (in fact: it is
done so in the [example.yaml](example.yaml)) by means of the presets system.
This system consists of two parts:

* Defining presets
* Activating presets from automations

**Defining presets**

Presets can be configured in the `presets` option of the `light`
configuration.

Presets are arranged in groups. You can define as little or as many groups
as you like. The example configuration uses two groups, but that is only to
mimic the original behavior. If you only need one group, then create one
group. If you need ten, go ahead and knock yourself out.

The general structure of the presets configuration is:

```yaml
light:
  presets:
    group_1:
      preset_1: ...
      preset_2: ...
      ..
    group_2:
      preset_1: ...
      preset_2: ...
      ..
    ..
```

*Note: duplicate template names are ok, as long as they are within their own
group. If you use duplicate preset names within a single group, then the
last preset will override the earlier one(s).*

A preset can define one of the following:

* **RGB light**
  * **red** (**Optional**, percentage): the red component of the RGB value (default = 0%).
  * **green** (**Optional**, percentage): the green component of the RGB value (default = 0%).
  * **blue** (**Optional**, percentage): the blue component of the RGB value (default = 0%).
  * **brightness** (*Optional*, percentage): the brightness to use (default = current brightness).
  * **transition_length** (*Optional*, time): the transition length to use.
* **White light**
  * **color_temperature** (**Required**, mireds): the color temperature in mireds (range: "153 mireds" - "588 mireds")
  * **brightness** (*Optional*, percentage): the brightness to use (default = current brightness).
  * **transition_length** (*Optional*, time): the transition length to use.
* **Light effect**
  * **effect** (**Required**, string): the name of a light effect to activate.
* **Brightness change only**
  * **brightness** (**Required**, percentage): the brightness to use.

**Activating presets from automations**

Once presets have been configured, they can be activated using the
`preset.activate` action. The following options are available for this
action:

* Switch to next preset group (and after the last, switch to the first):
```yaml
preset.activate:
  next: group
```

* Switch to next preset within currentl preset group (and after the last,
  switch to the first):
```yaml
preset.activate:
  next: preset
---

* Activate a specific preset group by specifying the group's name:
```yaml
preset.activate:
  group: rgb
```

* Activate a specific preset by specifying both the preset's name and group name:
```yaml
preset.activate:
  group: white
  preset: warm
```

Shorthand definitions are available for all these actions:

```yaml
preset.activate: next_group
preset.activate: next_preset
preset.activate: rgb
preset.activate: white.warm
```

**Handling of invalid input**

When a group or template is specified that does not exist, or if next
group/preset is used while no presets have been defined at all, then the
action will be ignored and an error will be logged.

*Note: This is validation at run time. It would be a lot better to
validate the names at compile time more strictly, so the firmware will not
even compile when invalid names are in use.
[Issue #15](https://github.com/mmakaay/esphome-xiaomi_bslamp2/issues/15)
was created for implementing this. However, a new feature in ESPHome is
required to be able to do this implementation. Good news is that this
is already well on its way.*


## Component: binary_sensor

Binary sensors can be added to the configuration for handling touch/release
events for the front panel. On touch, a binary_sensor will publish `True`,
on release it will publish `False`. The configuration of a binary_sensor
determines what part of the front panel is involved in the touch events.

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: xiaomi_bslamp2
    id: my_bedside_lamp_power_button
    for: POWER_BUTTON
    on_press:
      then:
        - light.toggle: my_bedside_lamp
```

For referencing the parts of the front panel, the following part identifiers
are available:

* POWER_BUTTON (or its alias: POWER)
* COLOR_BUTTON (or its alias: COLOR)
* SLIDER

If personal taste dictates so, you can use lower case characters and spaces
instead of underscores. This means that for example "Power Button" and
"power" would be valid identifiers for the power button.

### Configuration variables:

* **name** (*Optional*, string): The name of the binary sensor. Setting a
  name will expose the binary sensor as an entity in Home Assistant. If you
  do not need this, you can omit the name.
* **id** (*Optional*, ID): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
  By providing an id, you can reference the binary_sensor from automation
  rules (to retrieve the current state of the binary_sensor).
* **for** (*Mandatory*, part identifier): This specifies to for part of the
  front panel the binary sensor must report touch events.
* All other options from
  [Binary Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/binary_sensor/index.html#config-binary-sensor).

## Component: sensor

The sensor component publishes touch events for the front panel slider. The
published value represents the level at which the slider was touched.

*Note: This sensor only reports the touched slider level. It cannot be used
for detecting release events. If you want to handle touch/release events for
the slider, then you can make use of the
[binary_sensor](#component-binary_sensor) instead.*

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: xiaomi_bslamp2
  - id: my_bedside_lamp_slider_level
    range_from: 0.2
    range_to: 0.9
    on_value:
      then:
        - light.turn_on:
            id: my_bedside_lamp
            brightness: !lambda return x;    
```

### Configuration variables:

* **name** (*Optional*, string): The name of the sensor. Setting a name will
  expose the sensor as an entity in Home Assistant. If you do not need this,
  you can omit the name.
* **id** (*Optional*, ID): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
  By providing an id, you can reference the sensor from automation rules
  (e.g. to retrieve the current state of the binary_sensor).
* **range_from** (*Optional*, float): By default, published values vary from
  the range 0.01 to 1.00, in 20 steps. This option modifies the lower bound
  of the range.
* **range_to** (*Optional*, float): This option modifies the upper bound of
  the range.
* All other options from
  [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/index.html#config-sensor).

## Component: output

The (float) output component is linked to the front panel illumination +
level indicator. Setting this output to value 0.0 will turn off the
frontpanel illumination. Other values, up to 1.0, will turn on the
illumination and will set the level indicator to the requested level (in 10
steps).

```yaml
output:
  - platform: xiaomi_bslamp2
    id: my_bedside_lamp_front_panel_illumination
```

### Configuration variables:

* **id** (**Required**, ID): The id to use for this output component.
* All other options from [Output](https://esphome.io/components/output/index.html)

## Component: text_sensor

The text sensor component publishes changes in the active
[light mode](#light-modes). Possible output values for this sensor are: "off",
"rgb", "white" and "night".

### Configuration variables:

* **name** (*Optional*, string): The name of the text sensor. Setting a name
  will expose the text sensor as an entity in Home Assistant. If you do not
  need this, you can omit the name.
* **id** (*Optional*, ID): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
  By providing an id, you can reference the text sensor from automation
  rules (to retrieve the current state of the text_sensor).
* All other options from
  [Text Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/text_sensor/index.html)
